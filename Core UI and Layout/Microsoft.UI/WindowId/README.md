`Microsoft.UI.WindowId` is a struct used in **WinUI 3** to **identify a window** uniquely at the OS level.

### Why it exists:

When you're managing windows in a WinUI 3 app, like opening new windows, tracking them, or sending messages between them, you need a way to refer to a specific window. That's what `WindowId` gives you: a handle (ID) that represents **one specific window**.

---

### In Simple Terms:

Think of `WindowId` as a **"window name tag"**, not human-readable, but unique and used internally to manage and reference a window.

* `myWindow.Id` gives you the `WindowId` for that window.
* You can compare, store, or pass it to APIs that need to know which window you're talking about.

### Fields:

| Field     | Description                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Value`   | Returns the raw numeric ID (like a pointer) used under the hood.        |

---

### Example:

```csharp
public MainWindow()
{
    this.InitializeComponent();

    WindowId WindowId = this.AppWindow.Id;
    Debug.WriteLine($"WindowId: {WindowId.Value}");
}
```

---

### Summary:

* `WindowId` is a **lightweight identifier** for a specific window.
* Required for using **`AppWindow`**, **windowing APIs**, or **multi-window scenarios**.
* Struct = value type = efficient.
* Safe to compare, pass around, or store.
